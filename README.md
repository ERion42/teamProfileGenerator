# A Team Profile Generator

A Node.js command-line application that generates an HTML display for a software engineering team based on user input.

## Installation

One line is all you should need to install the code required for this

```bash
npm i
```


## Usage

Once the code is installed, simply run the following command.

```bash
node index.js
```

From there you will answer a series of prompted questions, entering the team manager and then inputting one member after the next. When you are done select "no more members" and the program will create an HTML file for you to use.
